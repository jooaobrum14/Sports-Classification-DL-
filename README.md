# Sports-Classification-DL-
From a input video, utilises the algorithm for sports classification using Deep Learning (ResNet50)

The algorithm utilises the transfer learning for classifies sports from a input video. The train file utilises images for classification and the final code use Open CV for utilising videoframes and classificate it.
